     <h1> About me </h1>
     <p> My name is Hairat Alatishe, and my Alt school ID is ALT/SOE/025/5631. I am a product designer who got 
        interested in Cloud Engineering because I am curious about what goes on in that space in terms of how information is stored, and the fact that 
        companies like AWS have data centers around the world where information is stored. Recently, I started browsing on what happens if these data centers run into issues, and it was intresting to learn 
      that there are various backups for such situations. In all of these, I believe there is a connection to blockchain technologies, 
        and the impact it would have in how information is stored and who have access to what information. 
        These discussions are crucial to have in an age where privacy is becoming blurry, and misinformation is prevalent. 
    
    </p>
    <p> While at Alt school, I hope to make the most out of this experience, while pushing myself beyond my comfort zone. I value collaboration, and 
        appreciate the perspectives people bring to work. I look forward to working with the instructors, my classmates, and everyone I would interact with on this journey. Also, I hope to make it to the end. 
</p>
<p> It is still day one!</p>
